# REST API

## For initialiaze the server go to the root directory and type the command:

npm run start

##

In this API you can make customer inquiries and their policies.

For this I leave the collection of routes and queries in Postman, in the following link:

To access the different routes, you must enter the '/login' route to obtain a token and use it as a header:
"Authorization": "Bearer $ {token}"
In the alls routes.
